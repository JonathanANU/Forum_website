#The modules that we will be needing:
    1. Matplotlib
    2. Flask
    3. Peewee
    4. radar
    5. Python (3.5)

#---------------------------For team members --------------------------------------
#Create an virtual environment with anaconda:
    1. open terminal
    2. type: conda create -n name_of_the_virtual_environment matplotlib flask
    3. type 'y' to proceed
    4. type: source activate name_of_the_virtual_environment
    5. type: conda install peewee
       note: depending on the privilege, you might have to type 'sudo pip install peewee'
    6. type: pip install radar

#Notes on virtual environment:
    Virtual environment makes sure that everyone on the team has the same setup
    ways to run '__init__.py':
    1). With Pycharm (Mac OS X):
        Go to setting (or preference):
            click on the interpreter and then click on add local;
            go to anaconda's envs folder, open the one that you created
                go to bin folder, click on a file called python then confirm
                    And we can just run '__init__.py' within PyCharm
    2). With Pycharm (Windows):
        Go to setting (Ctrl + Alt + s)  :
            click on the interpreter and then click on add local;
            go to anaconda's envs folder, open the one that you created
                click on a file called python.exe then confirm
                    And we can just run '__init__.py' within PyCharm


    2). With Terminal:
        Activate the virtual environment that we created by typing:
            i) source activate name_of_the_virtual_environment
            ii) change to the directory where '__init__.py' sits
            iii) type: python __init__.py
            iv) type source deactivate to exit from our virtual environment

#Operating guide:
There're two entries in the website:
    (1) http://127.0.0.1:5000/login   //this is for user(students) default user: u1000 password: u1000
    (2) http://127.0.0.1:5000/login-admin   //this is for administrator(lecturer and tutors) default administrator: u0000 password: u0000

#Notes on testing the actual usages of the project:
Delete the following files under the data folder inside Forum1040
1. delete 1040.db which contains only the demo data
2. delete demo_comment.txt, demo_post.txt, and id_demo.txt
3. delete post_engine.py and register_demo.py

On successfully completing the previous three steps, please do the following:
4. input the students' IDs in the id.txt
5. run register.py
6. run add_admin.py and create admin users one at a time
7. finally, you might want to change the debug to False on the last line in app.py
8. run app.py
